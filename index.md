# Your Name

**PhD in [Biomedical Engineering and Bioengineering Sciences] · Protein modeling & dynamics · Seeking postdoc positions**

I work on **gradations in protein dynamics**, combining molecular modeling,
NMR ensembles, MD simulations, and bioinformatics. I am particularly
interested in how **conformational flexibility** shapes protein function,
binding, and method development for predicting protein dynamics.

I am currently **looking for postdoctoral positions** in:
- Protein modeling and dynamics
- Structural bioinformatics / AI for proteins
- Computational biophysics

---

## Research Highlights

### Conformational dynamics in proteins
Analysis of hundreds of proteins with paired **AlphaFold models** and **NMR ensembles** to
characterize flexibility at the residue and secondary-structure level.

- RMSF, S², and PCA-based motion analysis
- Comparison of computational and experimental flexibility metrics
- Integration of dynamic profiles into ML models

### Epitope-focused mini-protein design
Epitope-engineering and molecular modeling to design **mini-proteins** that
reproduce conformational epitopes (including subdominant ones) for
therapeutic antibody discovery.

- Rosetta / PyRosetta workflows
- ddG calculations for stability and binding
- Focus on dynamic epitopes and cryptic sites

## GitHub & Software

On my GitHub, you can find:

- Tools for **protein ensemble analysis** (RMSF, S², PCA on NMR/MD)
- Scripts for **AlphaFold vs experimental ensemble comparison**
- Prototype **deep learning models** for flexibility prediction
